Based on the encryption technology used by the germans in WW11, program simulated an enigma machine.

Run 
<code>
go run gui.go 
</code>
to start program

This digital replicate contains a plugboard (usable by clicking on letters at the bottom; matches are color-coded), a reflector, rotors (3 in use, two not in use. swap rotor by left clicking) which also rotor after every press. Rotors can be set to default positions by right clicking on number below rotor image and draging up/down. 



After pressing a key on the keyboard, the encrypted letter will light up.

You can decrypt your message by setting all rotor positions and rotor rotations back to how they were when the message was encrypted. Then, type in the encrypted message and the decrypted letters will light up.

For more information about the enigma and the man who cracked it, Alan Turing, I would personally recomend the book <i>Alan Turing: The Enigma</i>
